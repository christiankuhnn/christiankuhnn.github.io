	<h1>Lesson 1: Phishing Links</h1>
	<p>Phishing links are fake websites or emails that look like legitimate ones, but are actually designed to steal your personal information. They often ask you to enter your username and password or other sensitive information.</p>
	<p>Here are some ways to identify phishing links:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The URL is different from the legitimate website</li>
		<li>The website doesn't have the lock icon in the address bar</li>
		<li>The email contains spelling or grammar errors</li>
		<li>The email contains urgent language or threatens consequences</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Remember to always be cautious when clicking on links or entering personal information online.</p>
