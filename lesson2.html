      <h2>Why are Safe Passwords Important?</h2>
      <p>Using a weak password can make it easy for hackers to gain access to your accounts, putting your personal information at risk. By using a strong and unique password for each of your accounts, you can greatly reduce the chances of your accounts being compromised.</p>
      <h2>Tips for Creating Strong Passwords</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
        <li>Don't use easily guessable information like your name or birthdate</li>
        <li>Use a passphrase instead of a password</li>
        <li>Consider using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for each account</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Practice Activity</h2>
      <p>Take a moment to think about your current passwords. Do they follow the tips listed above? If not, it's time to update them. Use a password manager to generate new, unique passwords for each of your accounts.</p>
