      <h2>What are Phishing Links?</h2>
      <p>Phishing links are fake links that are designed to look like legitimate links to trick you into giving away personal information, like your username and password.</p>
      <h2>How to Spot Phishing Links</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the URL - hover over the link to see if the URL matches the site it claims to be</li>
        <li>Check for typos and other errors in the text</li>
        <li>Be wary of urgent or threatening language, as this is a common tactic used by scammers</li>
        <li>Don't click on links in unsolicited emails or messages</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Practice Activity</h2>
      <p>Take a moment to review your email inbox. Are there any suspicious messages that ask you to click on a link? If so, delete them immediately. If you're not sure, reach out to your IT department for assistance.</p>
